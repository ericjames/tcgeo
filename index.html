<h1>About this Exhibit</h1>
<strong>Twin Cities History in Maps.</strong>

<p>
Presented are residential districts based off 1983 text and renderings in the quintessential Twin Cities urban theory book <em>Where We Live</em>. Authors Judith Martin &amp; David Lanegran determined these districts as being related by environment, architecture, aesthetic, and physical factors. Residents are unified by their "similar hopes and experiences" such as social, economic, and ethnic ties.  These "districts" can surpass official neighborhood boundaries, and can define a more organic map of how the Twin Cities evolved. Contrasted with these maps are historical maps and street lines to allow users to understand how history has shaped into these destinies. </p>

<p>Within each district definition are blocks which when clicked on can deliver additional information and hot spots in the neighborhoods which contribute to the district.</p>

			<h1>From the Curator</h1>
			
			<blockquote>
	"We hope to heighten readers' appreciation for the special qualities of each area and to provide them with an understanding of the processes that have shaped the growth of these two cities." - 			<em>Where We Live: The Residential Districts of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Martin &amp; Lanegran 1983</em><br />
				</blockquote>
				
		<p><em>Where We Live</em> was published in 1983 when the Twin Cities was barely a glimmer in the nation's eye. Half the highways did not exist, and the beltway signaled the boundary of sprawl. Professors Judith Martin and David Lanegran were still emerging into regarded Minnesota geographers.  The book has stood the test of time, as it was and is still a recommended listing on various University of Minnesota course readings including the eponymous offering Geography of the Twin Cities. The intricate history of where we live defines a past and present rich and unique. This project regards this knowledge as a critical tool to understanding our future as a region.

		<h2>From the Curator-Developer</h2>
		
		<p>When I learned of Judith Martin's passing, I was devastated over the loss of an enormous voice who carried a great legacy of urbanists and geographers &mdash; the arguable "Twin Cities School" of urban cultural geography. After the department reception, a copy of <em>Where We Live</em> had been left out in the MURP Lab.  I opened it and inside she had autographed, "To Barbara, With thanks for the inspiration you've been." This book had been a gift to Barbara L. Lukermann, a pioneer of urban planning who too had just passed in 2009.  I realized a proper homage to a great mentor would be to build a project that furthers this legacy of knowledge for the new century of internet medium.  I also was inspired by David Lanegran's recent book Minnesota on the Map, honoring the state's sesquicentennial with vivid historical "GIS" imagery.  A co-author of <em>Where We Live</em>, Lanegran is a distinguished, honored, and active professor, currently geography chair at Macalester College in the other Twin City, Saint Paul.
