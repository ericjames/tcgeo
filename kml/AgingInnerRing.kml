Heavily influenced by Dinkytown but also by the presence of Marshall High School, the neighborhood was both bohemian eclectic and family-orientated.

This made it a perfect candidate for gutting during interstate planning.  The neighborhood proper today stretches only a few blocks and is cut through by expansion of Augsburg and the University's West Bank. This area was and is highly transitional and much of it has been replaced though fine housing remains in spurts.  </div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Originally worker's housing for the Southeast rail yards, over time the University has drastically changed the area with student housing, parking ramps and new facilities.  Renewal first began in the 1950s with Glendale Townhomes, a public housing subdivision, and along the river with Thornton Tower.  In the 1990s private developers constructed modest new rental student housing and in the 2000s they created upscale, luxury offerings.  Two major condominium developments were completed during this time.  The majority of the land remains turn of the century housing, aspirations of the majestic Tower Hill mansions now relegated to student housing status.</div>]]></description>
